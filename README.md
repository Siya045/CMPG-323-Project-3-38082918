## TechTrends Web App
The TechTrends Telemetry Management System is an MVC web application designed to help TechTrends, our company specializing in developing and deploying automated systems, manage its clients and projects. The application also allows TechTrends to collect telemetry data from client sites using its solutions to measure time and cost savings.

## Architectural Pattern
**MVC (Model-View-Controller)** is a design pattern used in software engineering to organize code in a way that separates concerns, improves maintainability, and enhances scalability. It’s widely used in the development of web applications. MVC design pattern helps in organizing code by separating the application into three interconnected components. This separation makes development more manageable, the application more scalable, and the codebase easier to maintain and test. 

## **_Model_**
**Role:** The model represents the core of the application, which includes the data, business rules, logic, and functions. Essentially, it defines what the application does and what it’s about.
**Responsibilities:**
Data Management: It interacts with the database or any data storage, retrieving and saving data.
Business Logic: It processes data according to the business rules, ensuring that the application behaves correctly.
State Maintenance: The model can keep track of the application’s state, such as whether a user is logged in or not.
Example: In a shopping cart application, the model might contain the list of items in the cart, their prices, and the total cost.


## **_View:_**
**Role:** The view is responsible for presenting data to the user. It’s what the user sees and interacts with directly. The view displays data from the model in a format that is easy to understand and interact with.
**Responsibilities:**
User Interface: It generates the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to display the user interface.
Data Display: It pulls data from the model and renders it in a visual format.
User Input: The view collects user inputs (e.g., clicks, form submissions) and sends them to the controller for processing.
Example: In the shopping cart example, the view would be the web page that lists the items in the cart, shows the prices, and includes buttons to add or remove items.


## **_Controller:_**
Role: The controller serves as the intermediary between the model and the view. It receives input from the user (through the view), processes it (possibly updating the model), and returns the output display (again through the view).
Responsibilities:
Handling User Input: The controller interprets user actions, such as clicking a button or submitting a form.
Updating the Model: Based on the user’s input, the controller might change the model (e.g., adding an item to the cart).
Updating the View: After the model is updated, the controller determines how the view should be updated and sends the necessary data to it.
Example: In the shopping cart application, if a user clicks “Add to Cart,” the controller would update the cart model to include the new item and then refresh the view to show the updated cart.

### Managing Clients:
The ClientsController handles requests related to clients, such as viewing all clients, adding new clients, editing client details, and deleting clients. The controller uses the ClientRepository to interact with the database.

### Managing Projects:
The ProjectsController handles project-related operations, such as listing all projects, associating them with clients, and managing project details. The controller interacts with the IProjectRepository for database operations.
